- Quarantine the detected malware.

- Antimalware can remove most of the malware but **can not undo all the damage done by the malware in the system**.  
  For example, malware can infect system files, damage Windows updates and security and important registries, or even hide the malware somewhere antimalware can not find. 

- Due to this reason, in the event of a malware infection, **you must perform a clean installation of the system** using a bootable USB drive and formatting the C drive. (Do not use the reset option, malware can persist in that case.)
